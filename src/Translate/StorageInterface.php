/**
 * Interface StorageInterface for persisting custom translations.
 *
 * Custom translations used enrichments, collections and other information shown in OPUS 4 are currently stored in the
 * database. That made handling of custom translations easier. However in the future it might make sense to go back to
 * storing these customizations in TMX files in a central location. This would make it easier to modify customizations
 * with external tools. This interface is meant to decouple the actual storage method from the rest of OPUS 4.
 *
 * The concept of modules comes from the structure of OPUS 4 and Zend applications in general. The application is
 * divided into multiple module that each have their own translation resources. However in OPUS 4 users customize the
 * translations for most installations. So it isn't just a question of providing English, German and maybe support for
 * other languages, but it is necessary to support local customization that is easier than doing a fork to modify the
 * TMX files.
 *
 * For most operations the module of a translation is not important. All translations are always loaded, because one
 * module can depend on another and at runtime that dependency is not obvious for translation purposes. If a key is
 * used in multiple modules only one translation will be used, the one loaded last.
 *
 * TODO describe details of modules handling in API (expected behaviour)
 * TODO describe how to handle conflicts between modules
